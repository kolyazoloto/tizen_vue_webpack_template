# How it works

Hey! Hello my curious friend. Glad to see you here. 

Basically `vue-notifications` is a global mixin. All the stuff that you would define in the `notification: {...}` sections will be set up as a methods in `methods: ()` section. This is how you would be able to call them via `this` and this is why you shall not have same names of the stuff in both these sections.

That's basically all, folks.

And thanks.
